## Create React From Scratch

### Build

Type check and build the project by running

```
npm run build
```

Kick off the webpack dev server by running

```
npm run dev
```

### TODOs

-   [] use miniExtractCssPlugin or stay with style-loader?
-   [] move fonts to the `assets/` folder after build
-   [] render text color based on theme
-   [] primary color is not dark theme friendly
-   [] add global css override in both App and storybook. E.g, `box-sizing: border-box`
